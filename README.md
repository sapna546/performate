# Performate

Performate is a modern dashboard and runner for Apify actors, built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a user-friendly interface to browse, configure, and run Apify actors, with persistent authentication and dynamic form generation from actor input schemas.

## Features

- **Apify v2 API Integration**: Fetch actor details, input schemas, and run actors directly from the UI.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Clean URLs for actors and user dashboards.
- **Authentication**: Secure login with persistent localStorage-based session.
- **Dynamic Forms**: Actor input forms are generated from Apify input schemas, including support for arrays, booleans, selects, and containers.
- **Run Actor & Poll Status**: Start actor runs, view run info in a dialog, and download run responses as JSON.
- **Modern UI**: Responsive, accessible, and visually appealing with Tailwind CSS and Lucide icons.
